-------------------salbar v1.0.0 beta (Deleted)

important:
-fix bugs
-added support for ubuntu
-directory will be set by default to the current directory (based on console)
-Automatically highlights all text so that users who cannot select all text (especially Ubuntu users) can copy it directly when needed
-can skip all files/folders you want to overwrite
-move folders with pure move method (previously used copy method then acts like move but delete of source directory is retained)
-replace existing path symbols to user OS defined path symbols (since Linux cannot accept Windows path symbols)
-if the length of the error message text is more than 160 it will be stored in error.txt
-absolute path detection feature
-added working directory configuration
-character limitation from 251 to 250
-added a check that if the "Paths" folder has been deleted, then SALBAR will be closed (to avoid bugs)
-records the creation time of the .slbr file so that it can be sorted by creation time also on Linux
    -if there is the same creation time, it will be sorted based on the default from python
-added a help window to see all available commands and other information (type "salbar --help" in the console)
-brought the arial font from my Windows Font along so it can be applied on systems that don't have it
-added warning message box before copy/move action
-appears a progress bar when first started if the .slbr file is more than 64 files
-added undo&redo feature
-added entry scroll bar

-each platform (Windows and Ubuntu) will have a different message box icon
-added configuration support with yaml v1.1 (based on pyyaml)
-reduce file writing for images by storing them in memory
-can configure background and foreground colors (see features in the documentation)

With SALBAR, you can copy and move multiple files/folders at once.
This is the same as creating a batch file in Windows but you can do it easily in SALBAR.

However SALBAR has limitations that I cannot remove. Read Documentation.txt
