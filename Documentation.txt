Instructions and rules for use:

	Do not use numbers at the beginning of the name and use characters other than letters, numbers and '_' in the name.
	This is because the Name entered will be a string name also in the '.slbr' file (found under the "Paths" folder if you have created that file).

	Each path address is always enclosed in double quotes ["..."].

	If you want to use multiple file/folder paths at once, use ["(path)"] in each path address and include a space. For example: ["(path1)" "(path2)"].
	Warning: If you use this method on a source path, in some cases the destination path must be specified as a folder, not a file, to avoid overwriting and errors.

	Cannot copy selected shortcut files (unless they are under the selected folder) due to the file selection system.
	This can be overcome by entering the file path manually (remember: lnk = LNK). For example: ["path\cmd.exe.lnk"] ('cmd.exe' is the file name, and '.lnk' is not visible. So be careful when entering it).

Features:

	[...] is used to search for file/folder directories and then delete the previous directory.
	[+...] is used to search for file/folder directories and add input without deleting the previous directory.

	Since in tkinter you can only select files or folders, we created the options [Select (file)] and [Become (file)] to be able to select files.

Lacks:

	Due to an execution error when converting more than one initial file to one final file, we disabled the [Become(file)] feature if the user entered more than one file/folder path.
	However, this can still be bypassed because it only makes the file search feature on the [...] and [+...] buttons disabled.

	Due to the complexity of the code (since I'm still a beginner) and bugs, every action the user takes will make the check button unchecked.

	Cannot enter spaces in Name.

	Cannot adjust performance if there are many lists.

	The GUI may seem clunky to some people.

	Haven't tested it on another computer because I only have a laptop (lent by my uncle). The possibility of bugs occurring is very large.

	Very long execution time so it is not suitable for laptops or computers with low processor capabilities
