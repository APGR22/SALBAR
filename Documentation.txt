* INSTRUCTIONS AND RULES FOR USE:

	• (Windows) Dots at the end, spaces at the start and at the end will be removed when created

	• Each path address is always enclosed in double quotes ["..."].

	• If you want to use multiple file/folder paths at once, use ["(path)"] in each path address and include a space. For example: ["(path1)" "(path2)"].
	Warning: If you use this method on a source path, in some cases the destination path must be specified as a folder, not a file, to avoid overwriting and errors.

	• Cannot copy selected shortcut files (unless they are under the selected folder) due to the file selection system.
	This can be overcome by entering the file path manually (remember: lnk = LNK). For example: ["path\cmd.exe.lnk"] ('cmd.exe' is the file name, and '.lnk' is not visible. So be careful when entering it).

	• Changing it to another file only takes effect if it exists. If it doesn't exist then a folder will be created

* FEATURES:

	• [...] is used to search for file/folder directories and then delete the previous directory.
	• [+...] is used to search for file/folder directories and add input without deleting the previous directory.

	• Since in tkinter you can only select files or folders, we created the options [Select (file)] and [Become (file)] to be able to select files.

	• Buttons:
						↑ = Scroll to up
			← = Scroll to left				→ = Scroll to right
						↓ = Scroll to down

	• Shortcuts:
			-New: Ctrl+N
			-Edit: Alt+D
			-Delete: Ctrl+D
			-Copy: Ctrl+C
			-Cut: Ctrl+X
			-Exit the session window: Esc
			-Select All: Ctrl+A
			-Deselect All: Ctrl+Shift+A

* LACKS:

	• Due to an execution error when converting more than one initial file to one final file, we disabled the [Become(file)] feature if the user entered more than one file/folder path.
	However, this can still be bypassed because it only makes the file search feature on the [...] and [+...] buttons disabled.

	• The "Edit" action will make the check button unchecked.

	• The GUI may seem clunky to some people.

	• Haven't tested it on another computer because I only have a laptop (lent by my uncle). The possibility of bugs occurring is very large.

	• Long execution time so it is not suitable for laptops or computers with low processor capabilities.



Bugs that are better left alone:
	-Can scroll in any direction when the scrollbar is inactive
	-Scrollbar does not disappear if there is no checkbutton
Bugs that aren't too much of a problem:
	-In an Edit session or certain moments in a New session, both the source path and the destination path can be saved as empty
