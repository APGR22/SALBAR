# SALBAR
SALBAR is an application to copy or move file/folder with just a few actions.

# What SALBAR does and what it can do?
SALBAR only does what operating systems generally do, namely copying and moving files.\
These commands will be saved in file form and can be shared with other computers and even different operating systems (unless there are absolute paths that are not supported on a particular operating system).\
SALBAR tries to do trivial things that operating systems (common use like Windows) cannot usually do, one of which is copying/moving the source directory to its own subdirectory.

# Requirements:
- OS:\
Windows 10 or later.\
Linux (especially Ubuntu) or later (haven't tested it on other distros yet).

- Architecture:\
x64-bit.

# Other
- Compiler:\
[Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)\
gcc
