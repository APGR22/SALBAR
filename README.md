# SALBAR
SALBAR is an application to copy or move file/folder with just a few actions.

# What is SALBAR doing?
SALBAR only saves the source path and destination path which are then combined with the command to be executed by the command prompt.
As pointless as it may sound, at least that's what I learned in Python.
