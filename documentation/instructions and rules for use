• (Windows) Dots at the end, spaces at the start and at the end will be removed when created

• Each path address is always enclosed in double quotes ["..."].

• If you want to use multiple file/folder paths at once, use ["(path)"] in each path address and include a space. For example: ["(path1)" "(path2)"].
Warning: If you use this method on a source path, in some cases the destination path must be specified as a folder, not a file, to avoid overwriting and errors.

• Cannot copy selected shortcut files (unless they are under the selected folder) due to the file selection system.
This can be overcome by entering the file path manually (remember: lnk = LNK). For example: ["path\cmd.exe.lnk"] ('cmd.exe' is the file name, and '.lnk' is not visible. So be careful when entering it).

• Changing it to another file only takes effect if it exists. If it doesn't exist then a folder will be created
