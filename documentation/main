Bugs that are better left alone:

	-Can scroll in any direction when the scrollbar is inactive
	-Scrollbar does not disappear if there is no checkbutton

Bugs that aren't too much of a problem:

	-In an Edit session or certain moments in a New session, both the source path and the destination path can be saved as empty
